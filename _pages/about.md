I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biomedical Engineering and Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Johns Hopkins University, where I explore the intersection of computational anatomy, medical imaging, and vestibular neuroscience. My research focuses on understanding how the brain processes balance and spatial orientation—work that combines cutting-edge imaging techniques with sophisticated mathematical modeling.

My journey into computational biomedicine began with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Catholic University of America, where I worked with Dr. Christopher Raub on computational optical microscopy. This sparked my fascination with applying mathematics to biological problems, leading me to pursue an M.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Johns Hopkins, where I developed deformable brain atlases with Dr. J. Tilak Ratnanather.

I recently completed my Doctorate of Engineering at JHU's Center for Imaging Science, working at the intersection of Biomedical Engineering and Otolaryngology. My dissertation explored the central vestibular system using advanced neuroimaging and computational anatomy tools, under the guidance of Drs. Ratnanather, Agrawal, and Faria. I'm passionate about developing computational methods that help us better understand the brain's spatial processing systems—research with implications for balance disorders and spatial cognition.
